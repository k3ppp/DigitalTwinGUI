Attempting to make a sandbox environment. 

Should be easy to achieve the following:

1. Build a lab and modify it (load walls, doors, furinture, stls)
2. Manipulate objects via Transformation matrices
3. Integrate OPC UA (easily load and data and control variables if the ID and name is known)
4. Add simple gui funcions (text display, buttons) (connected to stactic data and/or opc ua data)


BUG
